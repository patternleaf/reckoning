- APIs of services to use
	- twitter probably most valuable
	- questions:
		- granularity of geo data?
		- are they delivering position data or geocoded names?
		- number of results/rate limiting
- openstreetmaps?

- general issue for geo data in social data:
	- content post will refer to is one thing, position of posting is another

- for future:
	- mapping "awareness pattern"
	- example:
		- consider river floods, tsunami, as indicator of global climate change
		- if we can extract information that 1.2 million posts are referencing an event
			- we can draw a graph

- workaround for those who aren't using twitter so much
- hashtags or keywords
